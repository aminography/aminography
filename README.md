Iâ€™m an android developer with more than 8 years of experience in developing android apps/libs. In my spare time, I'd like to work on new open-source libraries or answer some questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1631967/aminography). 

Programming is really a big part of my life and such contributions make me feel it's just not for a living and making money, I'm passionate about it indeed.
